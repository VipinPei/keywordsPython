The panel, he said, would examine working practices and propose measures that could be shared to strengthen the transparency of the financial and legal systems.

Mossack Fonseca, for its part, says that it has been the victim of a hack.
Mossack Fonseca partner Ramon Fonseca insisted the leak was not an "inside job" - the company had been hacked by servers based abroad.
It has now filed a complaint with the Panamanian attorney general's office.
Mr Fonseca served as a minister in the government of current President Juan Carlos Varela but stepped aside earlier this year after separate allegations linked the firm to the corruption scandal engulfing the Brazilian state oil company Petrobras.
Mossack Fonseca's Brazilian arm was accused of helping several of those accused in the Petrobras case of opening offshore companies in Panama in order to launder money through property transactions.
Mr Fonseca said he had stepped aside "to defend my honour and my firm" and denies any wrongdoing on the part of his firm in the Petrobras case.
Mr Varela has been quoted in Panamanian media as saying that he is still in touch with Mr Fonseca, calling him a "friend".
"At difficult times friends do not run away, they are there," Mr Varela said.
