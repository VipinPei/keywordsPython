This is What's Trending Today…

The Google search “How to move to Canada” reached an all-time high this week, right after Super Tuesday in the United States.

On Super Tuesday, 13 states and one territory voted to choose their preferred Republican Party and Democratic Party presidential candidates. It was the most important day yet in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump both won seven states on Super Tuesday. Trump now has one-third of the total delegates needed to win his party's nomination.

As Trump gets closer and closer to the Republican nomination, it seems, more and more Americans are looking into moving to Canada.

Simon Rogers is a data editor at Google. He tweeted about the sudden search increase. He wrote earlier this week: “Searches for "How can I move to Canada" on Google have spiked 350 percent in the past four hours #SuperTuesday.”

But that was only the start of the Google trend. The Google search “How to move to Canada” actually spiked more than 1,000 percent this week.

The travel search engine Kayak took notice. Using the hashtag #1waytocanada, it offered 10 winners on Twitter one-way plane tickets to Canada.

An official from the Canadian city of Toronto also offered help to Americans looking to move to their neighbor to the north.

Toronto City Councillor Norm Kelly tweeted: “To all my American followers tweeting at me tonight, here's the link.” His tweet included a link to the web page “Apply to Immigrate to Canada.”

Norm Kelly's post has been re-tweeted more than 46,000 times.

And, a resident of Canada's Cape Breton created the website CBifTrumpwins.com. The island off Canada's east coast is “experiencing a bit of a population problem,” as the site says.

The website also says Cape Breton would welcome “all, no matter who you support, be it Democratic, Republican or Donald Trump.”

And that's What's Trending Today.
