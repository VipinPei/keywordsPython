This is What's Trending Today….

Tuesday, March 1, marks the most important day, so far, in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. The day is called “Super Tuesday.” Voters from 13 states and one territory will be choosing their preferred candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties.

Donald Trump on the Republican side and Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side are the current front-runners. If they see strong results on Super Tuesday, that could push them closer to securing their party nominations.

The hashtag #SuperTuesday trended worldwide on Twitter, and was the number-one trending topic on Facebook.

The presidential candidates themselves used social media to urge supporters to cast their votes.

Some candidates used social media to insult their competition.

Republican candidate Marco Rubio tweeted Tuesday: "I've been making jokes on the trail, but here's the scary reality. Donald Trump is dangerous."

Not to be outdone, Donald Trump had this to say about Rubio: "Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio"

?But it will be Super Tuesday voters who will get the last word. Twitter user @Gbonbon13 wrote: "I am Hispanic, but I'm not w/CRubio. I am a woman, but I'm not w/her. I am a human voting for the greater good #Latinas4Bernie #SuperTuesday"

And that's What's Trending Today.
