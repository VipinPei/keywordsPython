Cambodia's ruling party spokesman has dismissed a report that the Prime Minister inflated the number of "likes" on his Facebook page.

柬埔寨执政党发言人对总理FB上点赞数量真实性表示质疑的言论不发表看法

Prime Minister Hun Sen, of the Cambodian People's Party, recently announced he had reached 3 million “likes” on the social media site. He joked that his popularity made him "the Facebook Prime Minister."

柬埔寨人民党总理hun sen最近发现自己社交媒体上的点赞数已经达到300万，他开玩笑说自己是FB总理

He joined Facebook six months ago. Hun Sen appeared to have overtaken opposition leader Sam Rainsy's 2.2 million likes. Sam Rainsy, head of the Cambodian National Rescue Party, has been on Facebook for at least five years.

总理在6个月前开通了自己的FB帐号，而且，hunsenFB上点赞数已经远超反对党柬埔寨救国党领导人sam rainsy的220万，而他已经开通自己的FB账户至少5年

Wednesday, a report released from The Phnom Penh Post newspaper said that only about 20 percent of Hun Sen's recently added fans were Cambodia-based users. The report noted numbers from the media analytics company socialbakers.com.

周三，The Phnom Penh邮报刊登了一篇报道：关注hun sen的粉丝中只有大约20%的人是柬埔寨本土使用FB者，报道当中提到的数据来自媒体分析公司socialbakers.com.

Many of the “likes” came from countries whose citizens would have little reason to support Cambodia's long-time ruler. The report also said a great number of likes posted in the past 30 days came from India, the Philippines, Burma, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico.

许多的点赞人都来自那些对柬埔寨长期执政领导人毫无了解的国家。过去30天内，大量点赞人都是来自印度、菲律宾、缅甸、印度尼西亚、土耳其和墨西哥

The report raised the question that the prime minister might have been buying his popularity on the site.

所以，报道中就质疑总理是否到网站上买赞

Chok Sopheap is executive director of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights. She said she was "surprised" by the report, adding that it raises questions about the transparency of Facebook's "likes" function. Cambodian politicians have used Facebook “likes” to compete for popularity.

柬埔寨人权中心执行负责人Chok Sopheap表示：她对报告内容感到惊讶，并进一步之一FB上点赞的透明度，柬埔寨政治家用FB上点赞数来比较相互之间受欢迎程度

She added that a politician's popularity should not be judged by social media activity alone, but by their effectiveness as public officials.

他补充说道：政治家受欢迎程度不应该只用在社交媒体上活跃程度来衡量，而是政府的办事效率

"The real concern is that the users themselves have to understand that the number of likes they gain on Facebook does not [accurately] reflect their popularity or [whether] there's full support for them," she said.

“真正令人担忧的是使用者自己是否理解无论在社交网站上有多少赞，都不能反应他们真实的受欢迎情况以及判断民众对他们的支持程度”

Nget Moses is head of the Internet technology department at Phnom Penh-based CENTRAL, an online rights advocacy group. He explained that Facebook users could pay money to advertise their Facebook posts or page, a mechanism known as "boosting."

网络科技部门部长Nget Moses解释：FB使用者可以付钱然后给他们的网页打广告，登上头条，也就是炒作

"We cannot use money to buy likes," he told VOA Khmer. "However, what we can do is pay money to boost our page or posts in order to reach a wider audience, as well as select where the page or the posts can be most seen.”

“尽管我们不能买赞”他告诉VOA记者，“但是，我们可以花钱把自己的FB网页推上首页，让更多的人看到，也就是说FB网页有更多的人可以看到”

The expert suggested that the administrators of the Prime Minister's Facebook Page could release reports on the page.

专家建议，总理FB的管理人员可以把报告放到首页

Sok Eysan, spokesman for the ruling Cambodian People's Party, dismissed the report. He said the prime minister had no reason to inflate his online popularity. He added that it was mostly people within the nation.

柬埔寨人民党发言人Sok Eysan否认了报道的真实性，他说：总理没有必要为了网上支持率而作假，而且点赞的大多数是本国人

Hun Sen has been in power for more than 30 years. He recently announced that Cambodians can send messages directly to his Facebook page in order to raise concerns and issues.

Hun sen已经执政超过30年，最近表示柬埔寨人民可以在他的FB上和他直接交流，以帮助他们解决问题和担忧

He also urged officials to create their own Facebook pages along with accounts for government institutions.

还要求所有政府官员都开通自己的FB账户，已经政府机构官方账户

Political observers said Hun Sen is hoping that he can use Facebook to gain popularity. Important local, commune elections take place in 2017 and national elections are to be held the following year.

政治观察员表示hun sen希望用FB来提供支持率，因为重要地区选举将在2017年举行，而下一年马上就要举行大选
