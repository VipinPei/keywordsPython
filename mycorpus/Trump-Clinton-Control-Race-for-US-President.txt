听力内容：

U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump controlled the race for the White House with victories across the country on Super Tuesday.

Clinton swept Democratic Party primaries in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Virginia, Massachusetts and Texas. Her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, won in his home state of Vermont, as well as Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota.

In the Republican Party primaries, businessman Donald Trump has won Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Virginia and Arkansas. Trump also came in second in Texas, the home state of Senator Ted Cruz.

Cruz won Oklahoma and Texas.

Hillary Clinton spoke to supporters in Florida after five states were called in her favor. She told the crowd there was work to do for the country. “But,” she said, “that work is not to make America great again. America never stopped being great. We have to make America whole.”

“Instead of building walls,” she said, “we're going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment.”

At his own speech in Florida, Trump reacted to Clinton's speech. "She wants to make America whole again. I'm trying to figure what that's all about,” he said. “Making America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again."

Trump also spoke about Republican candidate Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida. "I know it as a very rough night for Marco Rubio. He worked hard, he spent a lot of money. He is a lightweight, like I have said many times." He added, "Rubio was the big loser of the night. He didn't win anything tonight. He hasn't won anything period."

However, later on Super Tuesday Marco Rubio won his first nominating election with the vote in Minnesota.

As results from primaries and caucuses held in at least 11 states and one U.S. territory late Tuesday, U.S. presidential candidates spoke to their supporters at rallies, thanking them for their votes and saying they would continue to fight toward the national party conventions.

Speaking earlier to a large crowd in Vermont, Bernie Sanders stayed optimistic. "This campaign, as I think all of you know, is not just about electing a president, it is about transforming America."

Sanders stressed that Democratic primaries are proportional, and award delegates according to the vote count. "By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates," he said.

Ted Cruz spoke from his home state of Texas. He congratulated Donald Trump. But he suggested that Trump was winning because there were too many Republicans in the race. The comments seemed to be an appeal to candidate Marco Rubio to leave the race.

He told the crowd “We will not let the American light go out. We will fight for the American Constitution, for life and freedom.

A Democratic Party candidate must win 2382 delegates to get the party's presidential nomination. Among Republicans, that number is 1237.
