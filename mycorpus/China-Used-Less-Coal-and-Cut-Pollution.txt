标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：China Used Less Coal and Cut Pollution 

听力内容：

Air pollution decreased in China in 2015 after it used less coal.

Coal use fell almost 4 percent last year. By burning less coal, the Chinese cut carbon dioxide in the air by 2.5 percent.

Carbon dioxide is a major part of air pollution, also called greenhouse gases. It is released into the air when coal is burned.

“China is very serious about tackling air pollution,” said Lauri Myllyvirta of Greenpeace, an environment advocacy group.

Twenty years of economic growth made China the world's top producer of air pollution and greenhouse gases. The country has moved to hydro, nuclear and solar power and that has cut coal use.
