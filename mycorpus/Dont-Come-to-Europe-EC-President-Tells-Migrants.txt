标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：Don't Come to Europe, EC President Tells Migrants 

听力内容：

Migrants should not travel to Europe, says European Council President Donald Tusk.

“I want to appeal to all potential illegal, economic migrants wherever you are from,” Tusk said. “Do not come to Europe. Do not believe the smugglers. Do not risk your lives and your money; it is all for nothing.”

The EU president said the number of migrants crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey remains too high. Migrant smuggling continues to be a major problem. Measures must be in place to stop the illegal movement.

“Greece or any other European country will no longer be a transit country,” he said.

Tusk praised Turkey for clamping down on illegal migration and the smugglers who transport them.

Tusk is on tour of nations have trouble dealing with the migrant issue.
