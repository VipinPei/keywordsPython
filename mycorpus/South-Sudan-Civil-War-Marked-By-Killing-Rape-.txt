标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：South Sudan Civil War Marked By Killing, Rape 

听力内容：

A human rights group has evidence of killing, rape and disappearances committed by both sides in South Sudan's civil war.

Human Rights Watch, an organization that monitors human rights, said serious violations have been committed by both Sudan's army and Sudanese rebels in the East African nation.

The watch group visited Western Equatoria in February. At that time, witnesses reported that soldiers attacked homes. The military also stole property and displaced civilians, said eyewitnesses.

Human Rights Watch has asked for the African Union to establish a court to try the most serious cases of violence. Human Rights Watch and other groups have called for an arms embargo on South Sudan.

Tens of thousands of people have died in the past two years in South Sudan during the civil war. More than two million people have been displaced because of the violence.
