听力内容：

Nearly twice as many girls are denied an education as boys.

女孩接受教育人数是男孩的一半

That is according to a new report by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The report was released to mark International Women's Day on Tuesday.

根据联合国教科文组织周二妇女节发布的报告

A lack of educational options “stunt the lives of girls and women from one generation to the next,” said UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova.

而女孩缺乏教育会直接影响长大都对下一代的教育

Across sub-Saharan Africa, 9.5 million girls will never walk into a classroom, compared to 5 million boys, according to the UNESCO report. More than 30 million children aged six to 11 are out of school across the region.

在撒哈拉附近非洲国家，有950万女孩从来没有接受过教育，而只有500万男孩没有接受过教育。这些地区，有超过3000万6到11岁儿童辍学

The gender gap is wider in South and West Asia, where 80 percent of girls will never enter formal education -- compared to 16 percent of boys, according to the report.

在南亚和西亚性别歧视现象严重，有80%女孩从来没有接受过正式教育，相比之下，男孩只有16%

Girls are the majority of the millions of children denied school in Arab nations, UNESCO said. But the organization said exact numbers are not available because of conflicts in the region.

阿拉伯国家，大部分学校拒绝接受女孩入学，而且根据教科文组织说法：具体数字还不准确，因为某些地区发生冲突

Discrimination against girls and women drew worldwide attention in 2012 when Malala Yousafzai, then 15, was shot in the head on her way home from school in Pakistan. The Taliban targeted her and her family because they called for more and better education for girls.

在2012年，15岁巴基斯坦女孩Malala Yousafzai在上学路上头部中枪之后，全世界女性还在受到歧视的事情引起人们广泛关注。因为，Malala Yousafzai呼吁让女孩接受更好的教育，因此她和她的家人招致塔利班仇恨。

Malala survived the attack, after successful surgery in England, and continued to advocate for girls education. She gave a speech on her 16th birthday to the United Nations. She wrote a book, “I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.”

Malala Yousafzai在英国接受了治疗，活了下来，继续为帮助女孩教育做贡献。在她16岁生日上，她在联合国大会上发表讲话，还写了一本书“我是Malala Yousafzai，在遭遇塔利班袭击后仍旧站起来为教育发声”

In 2014, Malala won the Nobel Peace Prize.

2014年，malala获得诺贝尔和平奖

Alice Albright, chief executive of the Global Partnership for Education, said Malala Yousafzai helped show the plight of girls and women.

全球教育合作伙伴执行官Alice Albright表示: Malala Yousafzai给予许多女孩勇气和自信

Albright said discrimination against girls is even worse after elementary school.

Albright：女孩上完小学之后，遇到的歧视现象更加严重

Girls face more barriers than boys to further their education.

女孩在接受教育上要比男孩要遇到更多阻碍

The reasons differ, but include parents deciding they need their children to work in fields or do other work, Albright said. She adds that it is far more likely that girls are chosen for these tasks.

尽管原因各不相同，包括父母擅自决定给孩子停学去工作，而且，女孩更容易被家长做出这种选择

Another reason is that girls are often forced into marriages after elementary school.

还有别的原因是在小学毕业后女孩就被逼着结婚

Girls are also more likely to have no way of getting safely to school -- given military conflicts and crime problems in some countries.

而且，女孩在学校也很难保障自己安全，特别是在一些有军事冲突和犯罪问题严重的国家

And sometimes, girls or their parents decide against continuing education because, at many schools, girls and boys share the same bathrooms, Albright said.

有时，女孩和她们的父母不要再继续上学，因为在很多学校，男女要公用洗手间

Adding to the problems girls have getting an education is a lack of school buildings and teachers in many poor nations. Boys often get the chance at scarce resources.

许多贫困国家往往教学资源缺乏，女孩上学往往更容易遇到问题。因为男孩可以得到更多资源

“I do think some progress is being made, but by no means is it enough progress,” Albright told VOA Learning English.

“尽管现在已经采取一些措施，但这远远不够” Albright对VOA说道

The challenge to improving access includes changing long-held cultural views, she said.

提高的措施包括改变长期以来的文化观念

She said it is important that her group and others show the “many benefits” of improving access to education for girls.

她说：她所在的组织以及社会各界向这些人展示各种给女孩接受教育能够带来的好处

In a recent report, the Global Partnership for Education said educated girls are far more likely to get better jobs and more income. They are also likely to give birth to healthier children. And girls that remain in school past elementary school are less likely to be put into forced marriages or to marry as children.

在最近的报告中：教育合作伙伴组织表示受过教育的女孩能够得到更好的工作和收入。而且生下来的孩子更健康，在小学毕业后继续接受教育的女性也不容易被逼婚生小孩

A recent Brookings Institution report said better educated girls and women generally have fewer children. And that could reduce population growth in some of the world's poorest nations.

布克机构调查报告显示：受过良好教育的女性选择少生小孩，所以贫困国家能够减少出生率
