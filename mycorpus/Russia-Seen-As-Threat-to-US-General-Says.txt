标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：Russia Seen As Threat to US, General Says 

听力内容：

Russia is sending troops to several regions and sees the U.S. and NATO as long-term threats, said NATO's military commander Tuesday.

U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove spoke to a panel of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, D.C.

He said Russia has used its military against neighbors to gain regional influence.

“Russia has used military force to violate the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine, Georgia and others, like Moldova,” the general told the committee.

Breedlove said Russia has kept Ukraine from moving closer to the West.

Breedlove noted one of Russia's objectives is to hurt the relationship between the U.S. and its NATO allies.

The Air Force general added that Russia's military influence has spread from the Black Sea to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and western Syria.

“Russia seeks to re-establish a leading role on the world stage. … Russia sees the U.S. and NATO as threats to its objectives and as constraints on its aspirations. Russia recognizes strength and sees weakness as an opportunity,” Breedlove told the Senate committee.

Breedlove said Russia has done little to counter the Islamic State militant group in Syria. Russia started air strikes against rebel positions in Syria in September 2015, according to multiple media sources.
