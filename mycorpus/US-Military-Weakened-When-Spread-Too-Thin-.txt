标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：US Military Weakened When Spread Too Thin 

听力内容：

A United States military leader says he is concerned about the ability of the U.S. to wage conventional war against countries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.

U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General Mark Milley, told American lawmakers that focus in the Middle East has spread military resources thin.

The general told Congressmen if a conflict took place somewhere other than the Middle East, preparing for battle would be a challenge.

“If that [a conflict] were to happen, I would have grave concerns about the readiness of our force to deal with that in a timely manner,” Milley said.

The concern about readiness comes while tensions heighten on the Korean peninsula. North Korea conducted a nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February.

The U.S. has moved more troops into Asia. South Korean and American troops are conducting joint-military exercises.

North Korea calls the exercises rehearsals for invading the north.

North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, has threatened to launch nuclear missiles against South Korea and the United States.

Even with American forces widely divided, the U.S. and South Korea combine to have superior conventional forces in the region, according to the website Global Power.

There are close to 28,500 American troops in South Korea. America has maintained a military presence in South Korea for more than 60 years.
