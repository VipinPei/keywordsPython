Dozens were killed and wounded in an explosion near the main square of Ankara on Sunday.

At least 37 people were killed and 125 people were wounded and treated at hospitals around the Turkish capital.

“Thirty people were killed on the spot and four others died in hospital,” said a member of Turkey's health ministry. During the late night, three more people died at medical centers.

The explosion took place near Kizilay square near foreign embassies and government buildings. It was the third bombing in the capital during the past six months.

An Interior Ministry official said the blast was caused by a car bomb. The bomb was set off between buses to cause greater injuries and deaths, he said.

Another government official in Turkey told the Associated Press that police said the attack was carried out by two bombers. Police think one of the bombers was a woman. Police suspect Kurdish militants.

There has been no claim of responsibility for the violence.

The attacks targeted the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. That news came from the state-run Turkish news agency.

Nine F-16 and two F-4 jets raided 18 positions against PKK. Police also carried out raids in southern Turkey and detained suspected rebels.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the fight against terrorism will continue, and his country will defend itself from attacks.

PKK has fought a 30-year guerrilla war against Turkey. PKK wants more autonomy for the Kurds in southeastern Turkey.

The Islamic State group has been blamed for bombings in Turkey. IS was blamed for a suicide bombing at a peace rally in October.
