Learning Strategy

Learning Strategies are the thoughts and actions that help make learning easier or more effective. Plan to Learn is an important learning strategy because it helps you arrange your best learning conditions. You organize the resources and tools you need to study well. Here is an example of how to use this strategy.

Oluchi knows she needs to have a quiet place to study. She takes her English homework to a quiet corner of her home, and turns off her phone and radio. 

She brings a cup of coffee to help her stay awake. She makes sure her dictionary is near and that she has pencils and paper to write notes. When she begins studying, 

everything she needs is in easy reach. Her full attention can focus on what she wants to learn.

How about you? What conditions help you to study better? Some people like a little background noise, like in a cafe. Others need a very quiet place. Do you have a favorite chair or place in your home where you study well? Do you work better when you study with a friend or in a small group? Write to us in the Comments section or send us an email about your best learning conditions. Teachers, see the Lesson Plan for more details on teaching this strategy.
