标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：Iran Defies US With Test Missiles 

听力内容：

Iran said Tuesday it conducted ballistic missile tests to defy U.S. sanctions and to show its "deterrent power" and “ability to confront any threats.”

The tests came two months after the United States imposed new sanctions against Iranians and companies with links to Iran's missile program.

Iranian state television reportedly showed a missile being fired from underground silo at night. The announcer said it was a medium-range Qiam-1 missile, according to Reuters.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, is the security force under Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. On its official website, it said Tuesday's test was "to show Iran's deterrent power and also the Islamic Republic's ability to confront any threat against the (Islamic) Revolution.”

General Amir Ali Hajizadeh is the head of the IRGC's space program. He said “the missile struck a target 700 kilometers away.”

Last July, the U.S. and world powers reached an agreement with Iran on its nuclear activities. Iran agreed to remove most of its nuclear fuel and to avoid testing nuclear-capable missiles in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.

After two Iranian missile tests last October, the U.S. announced new sanctions in January against Iranians and companies for helping Iran's ballistic missile program.

The U.S. said the tests violated a U.N. resolution. The resolution banned Iran from “any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology."

Iran has always denied any link between its missile program and the disputed nuclear activity.
