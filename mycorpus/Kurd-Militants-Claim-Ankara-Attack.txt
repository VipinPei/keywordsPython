标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：Kurd Militants Claim Ankara Attack 

听力内容：

A Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility for the suicide car bombing Sunday in Ankara that killed 37 people.

The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, or TAK, warned that more attacks are possible.

TAK is an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The PKK has warred with the Turkish government since 1978.

TAK said the attack was in response to ongoing military operations in southeast Turkey.

Sunday's car bomb exploded in a busy city square near foreign embassies and government buildings. It was the third bombing in the capital during the past six months.

TAK also said it was responsible for a bombing in February. That attack in Ankara killed 29 people.

The BBC reported Germany closed its embassy in Ankara due to possible terror attacks. The Germans also closed its consulate and a school in Istanbul on Thursday.
