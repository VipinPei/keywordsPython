标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：Syrian Ceasefire Lasts One Day 

听力内容：

A ceasefire in Syria is underway, but frail.

The calm in Syria was broken Sunday when six villages were hit by air strikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based human rights organization.

The identity of the jets was not known. It was unclear if the raids hit areas covered by the truce. Militants from the Islamic State and al-Qaida-linked forces in Syria are not part of the ceasefire.

Russia blamed Turkey for nine violations, according to the French news agency AFP.

The Syrian state media claimed “terrorist groups” fired mortars close to the Turkish border. A senior Saudi Arabian official alleged Syrian and Russian forces have committed violations in Syria.

The United States and its partners targeted the Islamic State terror group Saturday and Sunday.

U.S. President Barack Obama said the Islamic State's territory in Syria is shrinking.

He said the number of Islamic State fighters in the field is decreasing. The reduced numbers, the president said, are because the jihadists are having problems recruiting to refill the fighting ranks.

The temporary truce went into effect Friday. Members of the United Nations Security council endorsed the deal.

One United Nations diplomat called the weekend ceasefire “reassuring.”
