U.S. military officials say they captured a key person in the Islamic State's chemical weapons program in Iraq.

美国军方表示:他们已经抓住了帮助IS在伊拉克制造化学武器的重要人物

The IS operative was captured by American special-operations forces. New gas attacks by the terror group were reported there Wednesday.

这名为IS制造武器的科学家被美国特别行动队抓获。周三又发生一起恐怖主义化学袭击事件

The suspect was not identified. His detention was reported last week, but his connection to chemical weapons was not announced until now. The IS suspect was taken during raids in Iraq and Syria by a U.S. “expeditionary targeting force.” Their duty is to collect intelligence and identify high-level IS leaders.

这名恐怖分子的身份还没有确认，上周，关于他被拘留的消息已经传出，但是当时没有透露此人和制造化学性杀伤性武器有关。该恐怖分子是在伊拉克和叙利亚边境，美国远程特别行动队发动突袭，将其逮捕，该部队的主要人物是收集情报和识别IS高级领导人

A Pentagon spokesman, Captain Jeff Davis, would not comment on recent operations. But he gave general information about the expeditionary targeting force.

五角大楼发言人，上校杰夫戴维斯最近没有对此次行动做出任何评论，但是提供了关于远程特别行动对的大概信息

“One of the goals, one of the missions we anticipate they will do is that they will capture a small number of ISIL leaders," he said, using another name for Islamic State.

“（远程行动队）执行的其中一个任务就是抓获少数IS领导人进行审问，了解IS下一步行动目标”

"The detention of these we anticipate to be very short term. It will be coordinated with Iraqi authorities.”

“而且我们只是将他们进行短暂扣留，对于他们的待遇也和伊拉克政府官员一样”

Officials in Iraq told VOA that IS fighters fired chemical weapons late Tuesday and early Wednesday. They said IS fired rockets loaded with mustard gas, also known as sulfur mustard, into a town north of Baghdad.

伊拉克政府官员告诉VOA：IS军队上周周二和周三在baghdad北部镇上发动的袭击中，都使用了化学性武器。IS发射的火箭炮中装有大量芥子气，也就是二氯二乙硫醚。

Iraqi and Kurdish officials said dozens of civilians were injured by the attack on Taza Khurmatu. Most residents of the town are Shi'ite Muslim ethnic Turkmens.

伊拉克和库尔德政府表示：在Taza Khurmatu袭击中，有数十名无辜百姓受伤，当地大部分居民属于什叶派

Soran Jalal, head of Taza Khurmatu's civil defense office, said “the rockets spread a garlicky smell, and caused nausea and vomiting." He told VOA that investigators confirmed the weapons carried mustard gas.

Taza Khurmatu民防部部长表示：“火箭弹携带的气体有大蒜味，闻到后使人感到恶心和呕吐。”现在调查人员已经证实当时发射的弹药中含有芥子气

A commander in Kirkuk, the Kurdish population center north of Turkmen town, estimated about 30 people required hospital treatment. Lieutenant Muhammad Qadir told VOA at least five of the wounded had facial burns caused by chemical agents.

库尔德北部司令预计将由大约30人将进入医院治疗。陆军中尉Muhammad Qadir告诉VOA至少有5起面部烧伤和化学毒气有关

Separately, a police official in Kirkuk said it was determined the rockets were fired from territory controlled by the Islamic State group.

此外，kirkuk警察已经证实：当时火箭炮确实是由IS分子发射的

U.S. officials are aware of the group's use of such weapons. They say IS has used chemical weapons more than once in both Iraq and Syria.

美国政府对IS居然使用化学性武器事实感到震惊，而且IS已经在伊拉克和叙利亚使用化学性武器不止一次

“This is a group that does not observe international laws or international norms. They have demonstrated they will stop at nothing to inflict death and destruction on innocent people,” Pentagon spokesman Davis said.

“IS根本无视国际法和国际规范。他们造成更多无谓的死亡和伤及无辜之前根本不会停手”

“Sulfur mustard - it's usually in a powdered form and it's put into artillery shells, rockets. And when those blow up it creates a dust cloud that can primarily aggravate but in large doses can absolutely kill.”

“二氯二乙硫醚以粉末装被装进火箭炮弹里，发射后在空中爆炸，形成蘑菇云，人体如果大量吸入芥子气就会造成死亡”

U.S. officials say IS is still developing its chemical weapons program. So some reports about the terror group's use of chemical weapons on the battlefield is “still largely about fear.”

美国政府表示：IS现在还在制造化学性武器。现在恐怖分子使用化学性武器的可能性还很大。

The officials say IS fighters find it easier to make and use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or suicide bombers to injure and kill people.

美国政府表示：现在IS武装分子开始利用化学性武器来取代自杀式炸弹
