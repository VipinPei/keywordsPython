This is What's Trending Today…

This week, people on Twitter have been trying to identify some unusual looking pictures. They are asking what, at first, might seem like a strange question: “Is this a photograph of a dog or a photo of a kind of food?”

A woman named Karen Zack, known as @teenybiscuit on Twitter, first posted the question: “Labradoodle or fried chicken?” Her post included photos of young dogs known as Labradoodles and a tasty treat -- fried chicken.

Labradoodles are dogs that are a cross between Labrador retrievers and poodles.

That question led to more viral comparisons between dogs and food. Karen Zack's next post compared sleeping puppies with a popular bread product: bagels.

More than 14,000 people retweeted Zack's “Puppy or Bagel” post.

And, in a Twitter post on Wednesday, Zack compared the Chihuahua, one of the world's smallest dogs, with another baked good: muffins.

?That post received more than 24,000 retweets.

Karen Zack's questions have quickly taken over social media. New York magazine called her a “Twitter genius.”

Zack herself seems surprised about her newfound Internet fame.

She did not stop at dog or food comparisons. Another viral post compared Sheep dogs to a cleaning product: the mop.

By Friday, Zack's idea had become a meme. Other people on social media are creating their own “dog or food?” photos.

One Twitter user compared Shar Pei dogs with melted chocolate.

And that's What's Trending Today
