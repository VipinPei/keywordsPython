听力内容：

Tuan Do of New York says Amazon has banned him from shopping on that website.

纽约的Tuan Do抱怨亚马逊把自己网购账户给封了

The reason? He returned too many Amazon purchases, he said on his website, TechWalls.com.

他在自己的网站上说，封号理由是他退货太多。

Do said he returned six items in the past two months. He said he was not satisfied with the quality of the products.

Do表示自己在过去2个月时间里只退过3次货。理由是自己购买的商品质量没有达到自己心理预期要求

Amazon first sent him a warning about his “unusually high rate of problems,” Do said.

开始，亚马逊给他发了“退货率太高”的警告

Later, when his wife returned a bicycle purchased on her Amazon account, the company cancelled both their accounts, Do said.

之后，他的妻子退回了从亚马逊上买的自行车，亚马逊就取消了他们账户

Mark Cohen is former chairman and chief executive officer of Sears Canada Inc. He is not surprised Amazon and other businesses are trying to stop frequent returns.

加拿大一家购物网站前CEO Mark Cohen表示：他对亚马逊和其他电商试图阻止人们退货过多的现象感到毫不意外

The costs are very high for a company like Amazon that offers many customers both free delivery and free returns, Cohen told VOA.

Cohen 告诉VOA要给消费者提供免费送货和退货是需要很大成本的。

The website Dyanamic.action.com reported that returns cost merchants $642.6 billion a year worldwide.

Dyanamic.action.com网站报道：每年零售商用于退货的开支高达6.426万亿

But banning a customer can create bad feelings. Greg Nelson recently spoke to the Guardian newspaper after Amazon UK banned him from its shopping website.

但是退货太多会被封号会给消费者留下不好的印象，Greg Nelson在自己的账户被英国亚马逊查封之后接受了记者采访

Nelson said he sent back 37 of the 343 items he bought on the website. He said he had a good reason for each return.

他说：自己一共退回了在网站上购买的343件货物中37件，而且都有正当退货理由

“I could understand if there were evidence that I had somehow tried to abuse the system, but I haven't,” Nelson told the Guardian.

“如果有证据显示我是在钻系统空子那么我能理解自己被封号的理由，但是我没有收到任何证据” Greg Nelson告诉卫报

Amazon said it only closes accounts “in a tiny fraction of cases” when it finds “extreme account abuse.”

亚马逊说：自己只关闭了很少部分钻系统空子的人的账户

Cohen, the former head of Sears Canada and now a Columbia University professor, said many returns are valid. It is fine to return clothing that does not fit, is the wrong color, or arrived damaged, he said.

Cohen现在在哥伦比亚大学当教授，他说：有许多退货属于合理退货范围，例如退回不合身的衣服，发货发错颜色了或者在收到货时已经出现损坏

But there are many cases of “clear abuse.”

但是许多退货很明显是“钻空子”

Cohen cites the example of people who buy a dress or suit, wear it once to a wedding or other special event, and then return it.

Cohen说许多人在网上买了一条裙子或一套西装，在婚礼或者其他场合穿过之后就退回去了

Cohen said Sears Canada had a customer who bought items from the Sears Catalog all the time C and returned every single purchase.

Cohen说sears加拿大就出现过一个人在网站上买东西，收到货后把所有东西都退了

Cohen said it seemed the customer wanted something to do and enjoyed placing orders, getting them delivered and sending them back.

Cohen说：有些人就是没事找事，到网上买东西然后退货玩

Cohen said he had to convince his staff to ban the customer. Some staffers said a ban did not fulfill the company's promise to “completely satisfy” customers.

Cohen还必须说服自己员工不要在给这些人供货了。因为一些电商工作人员认为不然顾客买东西不符合百分百让顾客满意的宗旨

He helped write a letter to the customer. It explained she could no longer shop “since we clearly have been unable to satisfy your needs as much as we have tried.”

因此他就自己给顾客写信，解释了这位顾客不能继续在该网站网购的理由：“因为本网站提供的商品无法使您百分百满意”

Cohen had won the argument.

Cohen赢得了这场口舌之争

On his TechWalls website, Do said he bought “almost everything” from Amazon. That included cheap items like groceries and toilet paper, and more expensive items like laptop computers.

在do的个人网站上，他写到：自己所有的东西都是从亚马逊上买的，包括日用百货甚至笔记本电脑

He said the returned items costs more than the products he kept. But he said he only returns products “when they don't meet my expectation.”

他说自己退回的货物比他留下的总价值要高，但是他也说自己只退那些价不符实的货物

Do had some support from his online readers. “Bob” wrote that he, too, was banned for too many returns.

Do也获得了自己网上读者的支持，一位叫Bob读者留言到自己也因为退货过多被封号

“It was a crazy high percentage in one bad month. But, yes, they were all defective. I wasn't abusing/trying and returning,” Bob wrote.

“没错，是有一个月退货特别多，但是是因为收到的货物有问题，我没有钻系统空子”

Cohen said online businesses like Amazon are getting hit with more returns than traditional stores.

Cohen说：类似亚马逊这样的电商退货率往往比普通实体店高

One reason, he said, is that shopping online does not allow customers to try on clothing or take a close look before buying.

其中一个理由可能是网上商店没法试衣服或者仔细观察自己要买的东西

Many products, he said, are returned after they have been taken out of their packages, often in bad shape. In the case of clothing, he said, returns often come in after the selling season ended for winter or summer.

许多产品，在退回来的时候已经被拆封了，而且严重变形。例如衣服在被退回来的时候可能已经过了销售季

That makes them hard to sell, or forces big price cuts, Cohen said.

这就使得这些衣服很难被卖出去或者只能被迫大减价
