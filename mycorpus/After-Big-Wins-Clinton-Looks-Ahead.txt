标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：After Big Wins, Clinton Looks Ahead 

听力内容：

Hillary Clinton moved closer to the Democratic Party's presidential nomination after winning primaries in four states Tuesday.

The former secretary of state easily defeated Senator Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio.

After a surprise victory in Michigan last week, Sanders spent more time and resources to compete in Ohio and Illinois.

The one remaining contest on Tuesday, in the state of Missouri, is too close to call.

In her victory speech in Florida, Clinton said she was “moving closer to securing the Democratic nomination and winning this election in November.”

She aimed her speech at Republican front-runner Donald Trump. “When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture, that doesn't make him strong C it makes him wrong.”

The Clinton campaign also Tuesday released a Spanish-language ad in Arizona. The ad focuses on Trump and not on Sanders, Clinton's Democratic opponent.

Michael Martinez is a political science professor at the University of Florida. He said Clinton's victories on Tuesday night were close to knocking Sanders out of the race.

With the latest victories, the Associated Press said Clinton has 1,599 delegates. She will only need another 784 delegates to win the nomination.

I'm George Grow.
