标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：青少年该拥有投票权吗

听力内容：

In Ohio's presidential primary recently, 17-year-olds were permitted to vote.

现在俄亥俄州正在举行总统初选，17岁青少年也拥有投票权

That's unusual because the voting age in the United States is 18. But during this election campaign, some people want to change the voting rules.

但是这在美国并不常见，因为美国的合法投票年龄是18岁。但是，在此次大选中，一些人想对投票规则进行修改

In Ohio, a judge ruled that 17-year-olds who turn 18 before the November 8 general election can vote.

在俄亥俄州，法官判断只要生日在11月8日之前的17岁青少年就可以投票

Several groups, including Generation Citizen, want local governments to permit all 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. Generation Citizen argues that lowering the voting age will increase interest in government and politics.

一些组织，包括新一代公民组织希望让当地政府同意所有在16岁都17岁少年都能投票。因为他们认为降低投票年龄有助于提高青少年对政治和政府管理的兴趣

“A lower voting age would involve parents, teachers, and community members in the process of learning to vote, and ultimately voting themselves, raising adult voter turnout,” said Oliver York, age 16. He is a junior at a San Francisco high school and working with Generation Citizen's “Vote 16 USA Campaign.”

“降低投票年龄，父母、老师和社区工作人员都有机会学习投票，自己也去投票从而提高成人投票率。”现年16岁，就读于旧金山高中一年级的奥利弗约克说道。他同时也在新一代公民发起的“16岁美国少年投票”运动效力

Arguments against lowering the voting age include: 16- and 17-year-olds are not mature enough and would vote the way their parents do.

而反对降低投票年龄的主要理由是：16.7岁少年的心智还不够成熟，即使是投票也只会跟着他们爸妈投

Here is what one person wrote on the website debate.org: “It's simply the fact that people at 16-17-years-old don't have the emotional or mental maturity of someone 20-years-old. Their minds are still crazed with the chemicals of being a teenager.”

有一个人在网站debate.org:上面写到：“16.17岁少年的心智没有20多岁人成熟是显而易见的事实，这个年纪的孩子脑子里都还只是小孩子的想法”

Professor Daniel Hart of Rutgers University has studied the arguments on both sides of the voting-age issue. He found knowledge of 16- or 17-year-olds about government is about the same as for 18- and 19-year olds. There is fall off for 15-year-olds, he said.

Rutger大学教授丹尼尔仔细研究了关于投票年龄问题持不同意见的双方说法。他发现，16，17岁青少年对政府了解程度和18.19岁青少年差不多，而15岁少年对政府理解和他们有很大差距

A University of Edinburgh study found many 16- and 17-year-olds do not vote like their parents. The study reported that 40 percent of these younger voters did not vote the same way as mom and dad in Scotland's 2014 independence referendum.

爱丁堡大学研究发现：许多16.17岁孩子投票选择和他们的父母并不一样，研究报告显示：根据2014年苏格兰独立公投结果显示，40%年轻投票者投票选择和他们的父母不同。

One reason for a lower voting age is that 18 is the worst age for people to begin voting, according to Scott Warren. He is executive director of Generation Citizen.

降低投票年限还有一个理由，根据新一代公民执行主管斯考特华伦说法，18岁其实最不利于人开始投票。

That is because at age 18 many teens leave home for the first time, either for college or a job, he said. They find themselves in a community they do not know very well.

因为18岁时候，许多青少年第一次真正自己独立离开家，去读大学或者工作，往往对自己居住的社区并不熟悉

And that makes it harder for them to learn about their new community's voting rules and issues, Warren said.

这也就导致他们很难了解自己所在新社区投票规则和需要注意的问题，华伦说。

Some countries already permit teens younger than 18 to vote.

一些国家已经允许小于18岁公民投票

Some examples from a recent survey by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency: Austria lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 in 2008. Argentina has allowed 16-year-olds to vote since 2012.

根据美国中情局提供的调查例子：澳大利亚在2008年放低投票年龄，从18岁降至16岁。阿根廷从2012年起，允许16岁公民投票

In Brazil, 16- and 17-year olds and those older than 70 have the option to vote. People aged 18-69 are required to vote.

在巴西，16岁、17岁和70岁以上公民有权选择是否投票，其他在18到69岁之间强制投票

Hungary allows 16- and 17-year-olds to vote if they are married. Serbia allows 16-year-olds to vote if they are employed.

匈牙利允许16岁到17岁已婚公民投票。塞尔维亚允许16岁已经参加工作公民投票

Abigail Koerner, age 16, is a junior at a Washington, D.C., high school. She is disappointed she cannot vote for her Democratic presidential candidate -- Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

华盛顿高中一年级学生，16岁的Abigail Koerner表示：她对自己还不能投票感到遗憾，因为她想投给民主党总统候选人桑德斯

Said Abigail: “I don't know enough about politics quite yet to make a distinction as to which party I affiliate with. But everything Bernie says about healthcare and education would benefit my life and the lives of people around me.”

Abigail说：“尽管现在这个阶段我对政治还不够了解，也不知道自己未来要加入哪个党派。但是桑德斯所说的关于医保和教育问题让我相信，他能造福与我和我周围的人”

Warren said teens who start voting at 16 or 17 will continue to vote when they reach 18, 19 and 20 -- ages when turnout is now very low.

华伦说：那些从16、17岁就开始投票的青少年在18、19、20岁之后也会继续投票。而现在，这个年龄段投票率特别低

“The United States now ranks 143rd in voter turnout, and we think we should be doing all we can to increase turnout,” Warren said.

“现在美国投票率排在第143位，我们认为我们应该尽一切可能提高投票率”华伦表示

In 2012, 53.6 percent of the voting-age population voted in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. That compares to 87.2 percent in Belgium, 86.4 percent in Turkey and 82.6 percent in Sweden. Belgium and Turkey require people to vote.

2013年，美国投票率只有53.6%，相比之下，比利时投票率有87.2%，土耳其86.4，瑞典82.6%。比利时和土耳其是强制要求投票
