Detainees released from the prison in Guantanamo Bay have killed Americans, said a senior Defense Department official this week.

本周，美国国防部报告：从关那塔摩释放的囚犯杀害许多美国人

Paul Lewis is the Pentagon's special envoy for closing the prison in Cuba. He did not say if the incidents occurred during the terms of President George W. Bush or President Barack Obama.

五角大楼关闭古巴监狱的特别代表保罗李维斯并没有说袭击美国人案件是发生在布什还是奥巴马任上

"What I can tell you is unfortunately there have been Americans that have died because of detainees," Lewis told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

“我只能告诉各位，很不幸已经有美国人被从监狱里释放的囚犯杀害”李维斯告诉白宫外交事务委员会

The Associated Press quoted an unnamed Obama's official who said the incident happened while Bush was president. Also, others have suspected that a former detainee was involved in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.

当地媒体引用奥巴马政府一位不愿意透露姓名的官员说法：谋杀案件是发生在布什任内。而且，制造2012年美国驻利比亚大使馆袭击案嫌疑人中也可能有被释放的囚犯

Guantanamo and Brussels

关那塔摩和布鲁塞尔

The information came during a briefing by Defense and State department officials to U.S. lawmakers. The briefing discussed how the U.S. prison in Cuba became a powerful tool of propaganda, or false information, for the Islamic State terror group.

消息是由国防部向美国国会做简报时透露出来的，简报是关于讨论美国在古巴监狱是否已经沦为IS有利的宣传工具

Obama administration officials have said images of the prison remind people of torture and prison without trial.

奥巴马政府官员表示：一提到关那塔摩，人们脑海里就浮现出折磨犯人和不经审判就将犯人关进监狱的图像

"Countries across the world and allies tell us that Gitmo hurts us," Lewis said, using a shortened word for the Guantanamo facility. "By closing Gitmo, we address a concern of the rest of the world.”

“许多国家和我们的同盟都告诉我们关那塔摩不利于美国形象。”李维斯表示。“但是，关那塔摩一旦关闭，我们就消除了他们的担忧”

But many Republican and some Democratic members of Congress oppose closing Guantanamo.

但是国会的许多共和党人和部分民主党人士不同意关闭关那塔摩

Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, said Wednesday that European allies might change their opinion after recent attacks in Belgium. Dozens were killed and hundreds were wounded this week in Brussels.

加州共和党众议员Dana Rohrabacher表示：周三在比利时发生的恐怖袭击可能会改变欧盟同盟对监狱的看法。本周，布鲁塞尔发生的袭击事件造成数十人死亡，数百人受伤

"Let me suggest that the attitude of our European friends may well be changing in the next six months or so when they realize that the slaughter that's taking place in Paris and now in Brussels is part of an international movement to destroy Western civilization and replace it with a caliphate," he said.

“我们可以设想，在未来6个月甚至更长时间里，欧洲各国可能会改变对监狱的看法。因为他们已经开始逐渐意识到发生在巴黎和布鲁塞尔的大屠杀，是哈里发政权准备摧毁西方问题并将其取代之实行的战略步骤之一”

Transfers continue

Some lawmakers, however, fear countries that have received Gitmo detainees, like Uruguay and Ghana, aren't prepared to properly monitor them.
