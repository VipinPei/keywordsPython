标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：Iran Says Missile Launch Was Not Violation 

听力内容：

Iran has defended its recent launch of ballistic missiles in a letter written to the United Nations.

Iran launched two missiles March 9. The rockets hit targets off of Iran's coast into the Sea of Oman, state media and Iran's news agency reported.

The United States and France criticized the launches. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 bans Iran from testing ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.

Gholamali Khoshroo, Iran's United Nations ambassador, wrote to the U.N. on March 23 that Iran did not violate the resolution.

Khoshroo said there is no basis for raising the issue with the U.N. Security Council in the letter. Council members met March 14 at the request of the U.S. to discuss the missile launch.

Samantha Power, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, called the launches “dangerous, destabilizing and provocative” and “undermine the prospect for peace” in the Middle East.

Iran continues to insist its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, according to multiple media organizations. Some members of the U.S. Congress have asked for more sanctions against Iran.

“Iran is developing a nuclear program, so that they can put it on top of a ballistic missile …,” Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado told VOA just days after the launch.
