This is What's Trending Today…

Chris Christie is the governor of New Jersey. Until recently, he was also a candidate for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. He suspended his campaign in February.

And this week, Chris Christie became an Internet meme.

March 1 was Super Tuesday in the U.S. It was the most important day of the 2016 presidential election year so far because many states held their primary elections or caucuses.

On Super Tuesday, Chris Christie was no longer among the presidential candidates. He recently announced his support for businessman and presidential candidate Donald Trump.

The governor joined Trump on stage Tuesday night, but he looked like he wanted to be somewhere else. And social media users took notice.

Christie introduced Trump on Tuesday to a crowd of supporters in Florida. He then stood behind the candidate, as Trump spoke after winning seven states on Super Tuesday.

During Trump's speech, Christie looked left; then, he looked right. He looked at the back of Trump's head. He offered an awkward smile and, at times, he applauded. But, he mostly looked afraid and worried.

One writer from The Washington Post newspaper said “it looked as if Christie had seen a ghost.”

Esquire magazine wrote “However awful your night was, it wasn't as bad as Chris Christie's.”

Some people said it looked like Christie was silently screaming for help. Or asking to be “airlifted” out of the room.

New York Magazine offered this advice: “Blink twice if you need help, Chris Christie.”
