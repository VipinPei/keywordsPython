标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：Chinese Businessman Pleads Guilty to US Computer Hack 

听力内容：

A businessman from China pleaded guilty Wednesday to hacking into the computer systems of American businesses.

Su Bin, also known as Stephen Su, faces a maximum five-year prison sentence for conspiring with two others. They were found guilty of illegally taking information from American firms that do business with the U.S. government.

Su was accused of hacking into major businesses including Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Su began targeting American companies in 2008, according to U.S. court documents. He obtained information about Boeing's C-17 military transport aircraft in 2010.

Two Chinese soldiers helped Su obtain military information for the F-35 aircraft and other jets, Canadian media reported in January, 2016.

Su was arrested in Canada in 2014. He owned his own aviation technology firm that had an office in Canada, the FBI said. Su agreed to be extradited, according to the Justice Department.

Chinese officials said the “Chinese government organizations and the military oppose and have never participated in any form of Internet hacking activity.”

Cybersecurity is a source of conflict between China and the United States, the Associated Press reported. American companies have lost billions of dollars in sales and in cyber repairs because of hacking.

Sentencing for Su is set for July 13 in Los Angeles.
