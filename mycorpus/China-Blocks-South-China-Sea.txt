标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：China Blocks South China Sea 

听力内容：

China has stationed up to five ships around a disputed island in the South China Sea, blocking Philippine fishermen.

The report comes from The Philippine Star newspaper in its Wednesday edition.

China recently sent ships to the Quirino Atoll, also known as Jackson Atoll, the paper reported.

Eugenio Bito-onon Jr. is a mayor on the Spratly Islands. He told the Star that Chinese ships docked at the atoll more than a month ago.

Chinese boats chased Philippine fishermen from the atoll's shores, the paper said.

The paper quoted an unnamed fisherman, saying, “These gray and white Chinese ships, around four of them inside the lagoon, prevented us from entering our traditional fishing ground.”

The Philippine military said it has tracked Chinese ships, too.

China claims most of the South China Sea. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also claim parts of the sea.

About $5 trillion in trade is shipped through the sea every year.

The Philippines is awaiting a ruling by an arbitration court in The Hague on the South China Sea territorial dispute.
