标题：VOA慢速英语附字幕：Report Says Americans Less Happy 

听力内容：

The United States has experienced a decline in happiness during the past ten years although it remains among the world's happiest countries.

That finding comes from a Gallup Poll and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network survey.

The World Happiness Report found that Americans showed “significant decreases” in happiness from 2005-2007 and again from 2013-2015.

The U.S. ranked as the 13th happiest country in the 2016 poll. The report showed that 45 nations showed a decline in happiness during the past 10 years. Burundi was at the lowest spot in the rankings of more than 150 nations.

The happiest country in the world was Denmark, according to the report. The top 10 countries also included Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Canada, Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and Sweden.

Mexico was ranked 21st and Britain was 23rd. France was in the 32nd position, and Japan was ranked 53rd.

Greece had the largest drop in the survey. Researchers blamed the drop on the debt crisis and high employment in the country.

In 2014, the Pew Research Center compiled a life satisfaction poll. In that survey, a top conclusion was that richer countries were happier than poor countries. The Pew research said Asians and Africans are the most optimistic people about their futures.

Money was a big factor driving happiness, but it was not the most important according to the Pew organization. The majority of those asked thought good health, quality education for their children and safety from crime were more important than wealth.
