From VOA Learning English, this is the Education Report.

这里是VOA教育频道

The United States is looking for sub-Saharan African students to study at American universities.

美国希望能够招收更多非洲国家学生去美国留学

There were about 1 million international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities during the 2014 to 2015 academic year. Fewer than 3 percent of those international students came from sub-Saharan Africa.

现在2014年到2015学年，一共有一百万海外留学生在美国大学学院学习，但是来自非洲的留学生只有不到3%

Africa is home to six of the top 10 fastest-growing countries in the world. But it is difficult for even the most motivated students to succeed in African universities. Classes are overcrowded. Teachers often go on strike to protest low pay and poor working conditions. There is little opportunity to do advanced research.

世界十大发展最快国家中非洲占了六个。但是对于非洲学生来说，即使是最最勤奋的学生，也很难在非洲大学学到好东西。因为班级学生太多，老师因为工作太低和工作条件太差时不时闹罢工。所以，很难举行科学研究

But studying outside of Africa can be even harder.

但是非洲学生外出留学也很困难

The U.S. government wants to change that.

美国政府想要改变这样的现状

Marcus Jadotte is the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Analysis. He is leading the first educational trade mission to Africa this week.

美国商务部工业和分析部长助理Marcus Jadotte本周打算和非洲签订首个教育合作协议

“They [African students] should consider studying in the U.S because of the innovative approach to education that we take in the United States, because international businesses are looking for the best-qualified, best-prepared prospective employees and we certainly believe that it enriches education back home in the U.S.," Jadotte said.

“非洲学生应该考虑到美国去学习，因为美国有先进的教育方法，现代国际商业需要最好的，最有潜力的员工，而且我们相信，这种交换学习会给美国带来好处”

He is traveling with representatives of 25 U.S. colleges and universities. The delegation reflects the wide variety of higher education institutions in the United States. The group includes representatives from two-year community colleges and universities that offer specialized advanced degrees. The team wants to recruit students and build relationships with African universities.

他带着美国25个大学代表去非洲访问。代表团里有美国许多高等教育学校代表，包括有2年制的社区大学和提供专业高等学位的大学。代表团希望能够招留学生和与非洲大学建立友好关系

“Many of the universities who have traveled with us on this mission are including scholarships as a part of the conversation with students here," Jadotte explained.

“这次随团的大学代表往往都给有意向留学的非洲学生提供了奖学金”

At each stop, the Assistant Secretary will join local government officials and academic leaders at an education fair.

每站，Jadotte都会和当地政府和教育领导联合举办教育展

The delegation's first event was an education fair for South Africans. Jadotte spoke about the academic support services and technology offered by America's world-class universities. His message attracted a long line of South African high school students. 

代表团举行的教育展首战就在南非。Jadotte介绍了美国许多一流大学能为非洲学生提供的学术支持和科技支持，吸引了许多非洲学生的注意力

Boneng Mofokeng says he is hoping to go to law school at Michigan State University.

Boneng Mofokeng表示希望自己能去密歇根州立大学学习法律

“I want to see the world and our country's economy is not good. Maybe I can have a better life over there," he said.

“世界这么大，我想去看看，而我们国家经济不太景气。如果去了美国我的生活水平可能会提供”

Jadotte says it is not just the African students who benefit from studying in the United States. The American host institutions also benefit from the increased diversity. He says Africa offers “a number of opportunities for U.S. institutions seeking to globalize their campuses."

Jadotte说：这样的活动不仅仅是去留学的非洲学生可以获益，美国大学也能收获好处，学生变得更加多样化。非洲学生的出现可以让美国学校实现校园学生全球化

From South Africa, the delegation heads to Ivory Coast and Ghana.
